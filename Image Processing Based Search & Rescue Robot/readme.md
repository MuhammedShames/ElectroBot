As a result of  the major developments in the robot technology, robots can now help people in their daily lives, and in some cases they can even take their place. Search and rescue robots are one of the best examples of such robots. These robots are designed to provide information to search and rescue teams, help rescue teams identify the locations of the living , provide primary life support and the ability  of communication with the victims in situations where human intervention can not be done or is inadequate such as natural disasters, explosions,nuclear disasters, military operations and mining accidents.
In the proposed project, it is aimed to construct an image processing based search and rescue robot. In thıs project the design of the robot will be designed with Solid Works  and controlled with Raspberry Pi and Arduino development boards. The appropriate motor and wheel selection will be made so that the robot can move on rugged grounds. Image processing will be done using a camera module and the OpenCV library. The robot will be able to identify the specified object and move towards it. After approaching the object, the robot will hold the object with a clawed structure on it front and then bring it to the specified place and release it. In addition, some of the sites data like temperature, humidity and pressure will be sended to a laptop or a mobile phone using different kind of sensors. An ultrasonic sensor can be added so the robot would be able to avoid different kinds of obstacles.
